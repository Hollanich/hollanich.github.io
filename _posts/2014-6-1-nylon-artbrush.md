intro: The Pure Nylon Artbrush is a new standard of paintbrush. It's design has been simplified down to one component&#8212;the bristle. The function driven form of this brush presents smooth line transitions alongside tiny surface imperfections. This creates an odd, but pleasing balance of continuity and organic uncertainty.
brief: The Pure Nylon Artbrush was designed by Nick Holland in response to MUJI's 4th international design competition, which focused on "long lasting design for living." The brief asks designers to build a product that will last for 10, 50, maybe even a hundred years into the future.
idea: Remake the artbrush from the ground up by keeping only the parts that are necessary and stripping everything else away. By maximizing the efficiency of the artbrush, a new standard will be created, outlasting and out-performing the previous market standard of artbrushes.
solution: An artbrush made entirely out of bristle. Nylon bristle that is. The 'Pure Nylon Artbrush' starts with a cylinder of raw nylon threads and is then melted at its core to produce the shaft part of the brush. The end bristle is simply left unmelted.
