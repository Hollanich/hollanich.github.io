intro: A lightweight, load-bearing, cardboard chair that can be flatpacked in seconds.
brief: Using a 4' x 8' sheet of two-toned cardboard, design a load-bearing seating unit.
idea: Build from the ground up, starting with a triangular prism for structure. Roughly fold the cardboard into shape and see where it wants to fold, then make score lines where those dominant creases are on the cardboard.
solution: To bend the cardboard in half, fold the sides down so that they meet at the center, and then bring together each end in the back to make a triangular prism at the base. Finally, Secure the loose end of the prism with a bolt for added structural stability.
