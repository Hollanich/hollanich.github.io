intro: This design is a pre-production model of a toothbrush, and was hand molded out of plastic by Nick Holland. Each bristle was individually inserted.
brief: Design a function-based toothbrush using an injection molded plastic. Complete construction without shop tools.
idea: Build a curved head piece that pushes the center of the bristles upwards, but keeps the general shape of the bristles flat. By keeping them flat at the top, the center of the brush head will have a higher tension/debris removing power than the edges. The gradual curve will allow the teeth of the user to go through multiple stages of cleaning in every stroke, transitioning from light to powerful scrubbing.
solution: Carve a wooden blank of the final form, then make a silicon negative with the wooden blank to cast the plastic resin in. Add bristles and detailing after molding process. Keep the toothbrush void of any overlay plastics or color additives so that it stands out in comparison to the over-designed toothbrushes currently found on the market.
