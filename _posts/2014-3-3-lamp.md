intro: Designed with shadow, light quality and manufacturing feasibility in mind, this lighting unit allows for flatpacking and simple, non-obtrusive hanging.
brief: Design a lighting unit using only one sheet of polypropylene plastic, cord, socket and lightbulb. All wiring needed to be done by hand.
idea: To use the cord as a structural element, connecting the entire system. Use the body of the shade mixed with offcuts from the plastic sheeting as packaging.
solution: Hang the lightbulb in the polypropylene and wrap it around a T-shaped top on the shade in order to hold everything together. Use red, fabric cord to display the connection point.
